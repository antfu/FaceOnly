# FaceOnly
FaceOnly is a plugin for the [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker).  

FaceOnly covers your opponent's minions so you can focus on **FACE**!!
It's just a toy for face decks, inspired from [this reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/30b5dn/how_to_play_face_hunter_properly/).

*This is only the demo, forget about the deck.*
