# FaceOnly
FaceOnly is a plugin for the [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker).  

FaceOnly covers your opponent's minions so you can focus on **FACE**!!
It's just a toy for face decks, inspired from [this reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/30b5dn/how_to_play_face_hunter_properly/).

* **Face Decks**
Works best with face decks.

* **Taunt**
**Taunt** minions can be seen with triangle bottom.

* **Toggle**
Toggle button is just next to your opponent's hero.
